## how to think about documentation

prd.md is the latest document with our plans for the codebase

tasks.md is our latest activity, status, and progress

the rest of our docs can be found in docs/

keep all docs updated, especially tasks.md. prd.md should really only change if i decide to change the plans on you.

## how to document code
keep documentation clean and consistent

at the top of each file denote its purpose

each function should include a definition which objectives it helps meet

any commented out code we stumble across should be questioned unless it is documentation
