# Agency42 - Task Log

This document tracks our activity, status, and progress.

## Session Summary (Current)

This session was dedicated to a comprehensive copy and strategy overhaul to align the entire website with our core value proposition: moving beyond simple efficiency to build strategic advantages for our clients.

- **Strategic Realignment:** Shifted messaging from "saving time and reducing costs" to "creating new capabilities and competitive advantages." This better targets innovative clients looking for a strategic partner.
- **Homepage Copy:** Reworked the hero section, "How We Work" framework (`Map, Design, Build`), and CTAs to reflect the new strategy. The main headline is now "Build tomorrow's competitive edge," with the subtext, "We turn your AI ambitions into real-world advantages."
- **Services Page Copy:** Rewrote the hero section ("Define what's next for your industry.") and aligned the `ServicesAccordion` content. Each service now has a clear, strategic purpose, and all copy reflects the partnership model.
- **Company Page Copy:** Overhauled the page to focus on the team as "AI innovation partners." Removed redundant sections and rewrote all team bios to be more personal, concise, and aligned with our new messaging. Corrected team roles and names.
- **Documentation Sync:** Updated `growth-strategy.md` and `case-study-research.md` to be the single source of truth for our new strategic direction and copy.
- **Button & Form Alignment:** Standardized CTA buttons across the site (e.g., "Let's Build," "Send Message") and refined form copy for clarity and consistency.
