# Agency42 - Task Log

This document tracks our activity, status, and progress.

## Session Summary (Current)

This session focused on deep cleaning and aligning the website's technical and strategic foundations. We accomplished the following:

- **Font System Refactor:** Resolved a persistent font loading issue by moving all fonts to a local setup (`/app/fonts`), eliminating network dependencies and ensuring consistent rendering.
- **Design & Typography Alignment:** Established a formal `design-aesthetics.md` guide to govern typography rules. Applied these rules across the site, notably strengthening heading weights (`font-extrabold`) for better visual hierarchy on the services accordion and other pages.
- **Documentation Overhaul:** Consolidated three fragmented strategy documents (`digital-strategy.md`, `copy-strategy-v2.md`, `geo_plan.md`) into a single, unified `docs/growth-strategy.md`. This creates a single source of truth for our vision, messaging, and marketing tactics.
- **README Update:** Completely rewrote the project `README.md` to be accurate, providing clear setup instructions and reflecting the current tech stack and feature set.
- **Content & Copy Refinements:** Replaced the "Proof of Capability" section on the homepage with a more dynamic video feature titled "Impact." Updated copy for better flow and clarity.
