        <p>agency42 was founded to guide ambitious companies through the AI revolution. We believe the next wave of business success will be defined by how effectively organizations integrate AI automation into their core operations.</p>

        <p>Ken Cavanagh brings a unique perspective to this mission. Trained as an industrial psychologist, Ken's journey led him through roles as a data scientist and operations leader at SpaceX, while simultaneously building AI products for startups since 2020. He's also served as a post-graduate adjunct professor, sharing his insights on the intersection of human behavior and technology.</p>
