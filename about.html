                Agency42 is an AI consultancy dedicated to helping businesses thrive in the AI-driven economy.
                We specialize in crafting human-centric AI solutions that enhance efficiency and drive sustainable growth.

            <h2>Our founder</h2>
            <p>
                Kenneth is an industrial psychologist turned programmer with over a decade of experience at the intersection of people and technology.
                His unique background allows him to understand both the technical and human aspects of organizational success.
            </p>
            <p>
                At <strong>SpaceX</strong>, Kenneth leveraged data science and organizational theory to inform workforce strategy and improve operational efficiency.
                As an adjunct professor at <strong>CUNY Brooklyn College</strong>, he taught graduate students about technologies that enable organizations to operate more efficiently and how people, behaviors, and processes evolve around them.
            </p>
            <p>
                An entrepreneur at heart, Kenneth co-founded <strong>TalentDAO</strong>, a community-funded research organization focused on optimizing operations for Discord-native organizations.
                There, he led psychometric research and developed <strong>Leo</strong>, a Discord assistant for researchers that integrates project and research data using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
                He also co-founded <strong>Noometic AI</strong>, a natural language search engine designed to discover creative talent.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Kenneth founded Agency42 to help businesses embrace the next era of automation.
