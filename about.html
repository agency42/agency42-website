                <p class="bio-intro">After leading operations engineering teams at SpaceX and building AI products for several startups on the side, Ken has committed to building the future as he sees it.</p>
                
                <p>His vision for how AI integrates with businesses comes from a unique perspective influenced by his positioning over the last half decade at the intersection of people, business, and technology. As an industrial psychologist trained at Brooklyn College in New York, where he also taught as a post-grad adjunct, Ken brings a human-centered approach to technological innovation.</p>
                
                <p>Throughout his career at SpaceX, Ken simultaneously helped build innovative startups like talentDAO, Noometic AI, and WiseRx. He's been building tools with LLMs since early 2020, when GPT-3 first became available via API, while also mastering the optimization of business operations through sophisticated data pipelines.</p>
                
                <p class="mission-statement">Ken's mission is to ensure that anyone with a vision for their business's success doesn't get left behind in the AI boom.</p>
