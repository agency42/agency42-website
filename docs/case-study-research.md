# Case Study Research & Inspiration

**Note:** Our case studies must now align with our core strategy of building **new capabilities and strategic advantages.** While time and cost savings are valuable, the primary narrative of each case study should focus on how we helped a client do something they couldn't do before, enter a new market, or create a durable competitive advantage.

This document collects references and notes on exceptional case-study examples to inform the redesign of Agency42's project section.

## Common Patterns Observed

- **Hero with key outcomes** (e.g., "Launched New Product Line," "Automated Core Business Function") immediately communicates impact.
- **Problem → Solution → Strategic Advantage** narrative keeps the story clear.
- **Rich visuals** (before/after, product UI, architecture diagrams) break up text.
- **Sticky in-page nav** aids long-form scanning.
- **Strong CTA** ("Let's build your advantage") after the proof section.

## Design Elements Worth Borrowing

- Pull-quotes from stakeholders.
- Side-by-side timeline of actions & results.
- Code snippets or architecture diagrams for technical depth.
