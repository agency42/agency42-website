# Agency42 Copy Revision Core Principles

## 1. Say What You Actually Do
**From:** "Human Efficiency Through AI"  
**To:** "We build AI solutions using vibe coding, strategic consulting, and custom development"

Be specific. Name your services. Kill the abstractions.

## 2. Lead With What's Different
- **Vibe coding expertise** (trending topic, unique offering)
- **We build AND teach** (not just consultants)
- **Real products** (Daybloom proves capability)

If everyone says it, don't say it.

## 3. Show Results, Not Process
**From:** "We guide clients through transformation"  
**To:** "Build working AI products in days, not months"

Focus on outcomes and speed. That's what clients buy.

## 4. Make It Scannable
- **Hero:** What you do in one sentence
- **Services:** Three clear buckets
- **Proof:** Daybloom front and center
- **Action:** Specific CTAs ("Book a Vibe Code Workshop")

If they can't understand it in 10 seconds, you've lost them.

## The Test
A visitor should instantly know:
1. You build AI fast
2. You teach others to build AI fast  
3. You have proof it works

Everything else is detail.
