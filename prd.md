        Below is the opinion-driven, no-ambiguity blueprint for the complete Agency 42 website overhaul and the 90-day execution play-book.

        Everything is written so a separate coder/design squad can ship without ping-pong.

        ‚ö° PRD ‚Äî ‚ÄúAgency 42 v2‚Äù (consulting-first site)
        1. Executive Summary
        Rebuild agency42.co into a consulting-led conversion engine that:
        Positions Agency 42 as the authority on human efficiency through AI (promise: ‚ÄúTurn Unknown-Unknowns into 10√ó Outcomes‚Äù).


        Converts cold visitors into qualified discovery calls ‚Üí paid ‚ÄúAI Opportunity Audit‚Äù ‚Üí retainer clients.


        Uses Bootoshi's creator aura as social proof while future-proofing against single-face risk.


        2. Scope & Context
        Area
        In-scope
        Out-of-scope
        UI / Brand

        Psychological Lever
        Hero
        ‚ÄúStop Guessing. Start Operating at AI Speed.‚Äù
        Gap-in-knowledge, FOMO
        Proof bar
        ‚ú¶ ‚Äú3 000 + professionals unlocked 10√ó output‚Äù ‚ú¶ YouTube 25 k subs ‚ú¶ 1.8 M view counter <!-- Placeholder for client logos pending permission -->
        Social proof, Bandwagon
        Problem block
        ‚ÄúYou don't know what you don't know. That's fatal in 2025.‚Äù
        Loss aversion
        Solution trio
        AI Opportunity Audit ‚Üí Hands-on Workshop ‚Üí Fractional AI CTO Retainer

        Micro-stories (‚â§50 w) + measurable result placeholder. <!-- Placeholder for testimonials pending permission -->
        Specificity over fluff

        5. Visual & UI System
        Element
        Spec
        Colour
        Base #FFFFFF / #0C0C0C. Accent gradient ‚ÄúNeon Magma‚Äù (#FF6B00 ‚Üí #FF005C) to echo vibe coding energy.
        Typography
        Satoshi for body; Founders Grotesk for display (mirrors tech-luxury vibe).
        Imagery
        Generative renders of ‚Äúenergy flows‚Äù + real workshop photos (even phone-quality) for authenticity.
        Motion
        Sub-200 ms micro-interactions; hero background subtle animated flow line (SVG).
        Accessibility
        WCAG 2.1 AA, prefers-reduced-motion respects.

        6. Martech & Analytics Stack (green-field)
        Need
        Tool
        Why
        CRM / email
        HubSpot Starter
        Native Calendly + Stripe sync; free tier scales to 1 000 contacts.
        Booking
        Calendly round-robin
        Auto-qual questions (Industry, Team Size, Budget).
        Analytics
        Plausible
        GDPR-safe, lightweight INP tracking.
        A/B / Feature Flags
        PostHog
        Self-hosted, event funnels, toggles for CTA copy tests.
        Newsletter
        ConvertKit via Zapier ‚Üí HubSpot
        Simple sequences; can migrate later.
        Lead tracking
        Bitly branded links a42.link
        Per-video attribution just like Morningside.

        (All tools have free or <$50 / mo tiers; total SaaS burn < $200 / mo.)
        7. Legal & Compliance Must-Haves
        Privacy Policy & Terms ‚Äì generate via Termly; host /legal/.


        Cookie-less analytics removes consent banner complexity.


        DPA & SCC boilerplate in MSA for EU clients (template via Ironclad).


        IP assignment clause in SOWs (work-product ‚Üí client) ‚Äì de-risks procurement objections.
        No additional regulated-industry compliance until a specific client demands it.


        8. KPIs & Acceptance Criteria (first 90 days)
        KPI
        Definition
        Pass bar
        Hero CTA CTR
        (QualForm submits / Hero views)
        ‚â• 7 %
        Qualified discovery calls
        (Calendly links sent after manual review / QualForm submits) AND (Budget ‚â• $5k indicated)
        Metric TBD based on form data
        Audit conversion
        Audits sold / qualified calls

        9. Risks & Mitigations
        Risk
        Mitigation
        ‚Äú10√ó‚Äù claim challenged
        Phrase as ‚Äúup to 10√ó efficiency documented in client workflows‚Äù and footnote methodology.
        Single-person brand dependency
        Prominently feature Ken & Rob expertise blocks; rotate them in blog authorship.
        No hard case-study numbers at launch
        Start with ‚Äúprototype projects‚Äù metrics (your builds) + collect client baselines early for v2 update.
        Tool sprawl / SaaS fatigue
        Quarterly stack review; keep spend under $200 / mo.

        Hard launch target: Week 12 (‚âà 3 months).

        Strong Opinion in One Sentence
        Blend Bootoshi's creator fire-hose with radical pricing transparency and a qualification wall‚Äîanything else is friction that costs you five-figure retainers.
        Execute the plan above exactly; the site will generate leads while you sleep, and you'll never waste another hour on ‚Äútyre-kicker‚Äù calls.
